### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Mahesa Lizardy 
I'm a beginner programmer. Currently, I'm a student at Institut Teknologi Bandung, 
I'm looking to connect with other developers who are also just starting out, as well as more experienced developers who can offer guidance and advice. 

Thanks for stopping by, and happy coding! ðŸš€
